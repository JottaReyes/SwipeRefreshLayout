CustomSwipeRefreshLayout
========================

CustomSwipeRefreshLayout is a modified version of android.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout, which supports custom refresh headviews with custom animations. You can add almost any View in CustomSwipeRefreshLayout, NOT ONLY Listview. Note that CustomSwipeRefreshLayout can only contain one child View.  You can make your own custom headview which contains the refreshing infomation like images, texts, animations....(A default headview is provided) and content View.
The following screenshots shows the default refresh headview with animations:
